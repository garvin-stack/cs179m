# Team Port Organizer

This repository contains the code for container balancing, loading & unloading of containers. The code is developed using Python, and the GUI for loading & unloading is developed using Tkinter, while the GUI for balancing is developed using PyQt.

## Overview

The system comprises a several Python scripts (`loadingunloading.py`, `balance.py`, `main.py`, `final.py`) that automates the required process. On completion of the loading & unloading process, it generates a `manifest_outbound` file, serving as a record of the final container status and details.

## Files in the Repository

### `loadingunloading.py`

- **Functionality**: This script manages the loading and unloading of containers. It includes features to track container status, update records, and optimize the loading/unloading operations using A* search algorithm which uses heuristic cost search.
- **How to Use**: Execute this script to start the process. Input the required data as prompted, and the script will handle the rest, ensuring accurate and efficient container management.

### `manifest_outbound`

- **Description**: This file is an output generated by `loadingunloading.py`. It acts as a final manifest for outbound containers, detailing essential information like contents, destination location to which it has been moved.
- **File Format Input**: The input is a plain text file, which has location coordinates, the wights and the names of various containers in a 8 * 12 layout.

## Setup and Usage

To get started with this system:

1. Ensure Python is installed on your machine.
2. Clone this repository to your local environment.
3. Navigate to the repository folder and run `python loadingunloading.py`.
4. Follow the prompts to input necessary data for container handling.
5. Upon completion, check the `manifest_outbound` file for the final manifest details.
